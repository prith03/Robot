# Package Summary
The Python package that I used in Robot.py is math. The math package allows coders to perform various mathematical operations, ranging from basic funcation to advanced calculations. Some examples of what the math package has to offer are calculating trigonometric functions(sine, cosine, tangent), rounding, ceiling, flooring, accessing constants like pi, e, and many more. 

# Install and Run Instructions
If you're trying to code in Python, accessing the math package is very simple. Since Python has numerous built-in packages, installing packages is completely not required. You simply just have to import the math package at the very beginning and you can start using any of the mathematical functions under the package.

# Code
To summarize what my code is about, it basically tells the robot which direction it should go and how many steps to take. For every trace the user tells the robot to do, the robot will perform that trace. After every trace, the direction will tell whether the robot went UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Based on that, the number of steps will be placed into two variable counts: verticalStepsCount and horizontalStepsCount. This process keeps repeating until the user decides to end the tracing. The horizontalStepsCount and verticalStepsCount will then be used as the final destination of the robot. From there, the distance formula will be performed to find the distance from the origin to the robot's destination. 

# Future idea
The math package is very useful for any time you need to perform any calculations. If it was used for a final project, it would be very useful if you needed to calculate the average of something, find the area, perimeter, circumference, etc.
